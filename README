This project is my Senior Project for CSU Chico.

It is a game called Omnarcanum, written in Lua and compiled using Corona SDK.

It will be released on iOS and Android at the completion of my project.

Code Notes:
	So far, so good.  Code looks solid.

Content Notes:
	.rconfig file done for maps 1 & 2.  3 is begun.  Rest are old.
	Sprite second drafts completed

Done:
	Movement- EDITED: Fixed bugs.  God, sometimes I feel dumb. Had some slight errors in edge detection.  System is foolproof- hopefully. EDITED: So, apparently not.  Overlap code was erroneous (missed a /2 on the width of an object). EDITED: Seriously?  Yes.  Wall overlap was only calculated when the player was at the edge of the screen.  Moved around the movement code so it's a little smarter.  Next edit to this section will make me die on the inside.
	Room Transitions
	rconfig parser
		-Extensible (Add a new field to rconfig, and it'll be a simple task to add the addtional check to the parse function)
	Objects added to rconfig (includes elemental vulnerabilities)
	Player sprite changes based on current direction
	Direction is stored
	Player shoots spells in direction currently facing
	Scarecrows die when shot with fire
	Fuses implemented
	Boulders explode after fuse burns down
	Zone change works
	Collision is fixed
